# Automotive-Expert-AI
An Automotive Diagnostic/Repair program that utilizes a backward-chaining inference engine, a forward-chaining inference engine, and a knowledge base.  

The Automotive Expert System development team consisted of three members: Rowan Stone, Kadon Fontenot, and Goldstein Huynh. Rowan conducted online research on common automotive issues and repairs, was the primary programmer for the diagnostic procedure of the program, implemented the Diagnostic Engine (Backward Chaining inference engine) program with the associated Knowledge Base data structures, and linked the User Interface class to the program through the design of a main controller program at the heart of the Automotive Expert System. Rowan also reviewed and revised rule sets, decision trees, and forward chaining program implementations, and user interface code. Kadon was the primary designer of the rule set needed for the diagnostic procedure, the diagnostic/repair decision tree, and the user interface implementation, since he was the team member with the most practical experience in automotive troubleshooting and repair and was also the primary tester of the system. Goldstein was the primary programmer for the Repair Advisor (Forward Chaining inference engine) program.
